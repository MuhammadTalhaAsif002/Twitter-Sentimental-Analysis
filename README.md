# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data using Apache Spark

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on a large dataset of tweets using Apache Spark. The project involves collecting tweets, preprocessing the data, performing sentiment analysis using machine learning algorithms, and visualizing the results.

## Deliverables
- **Final Report**: Detailed documentation of every task, including data collection methodology, preprocessing steps, analysis techniques, findings, and interpretations.
- **Code Repository**: Python notebooks containing the Apache Spark code/scripts built during the process.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Gathering
- Get the dataset from kaggle 
- Store the collected tweets in a distributed file system such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

### Task 2: Data Preprocessing
- Load the tweet dataset into Apache Spark DataFrame.
- Perform data cleaning by removing retweets, duplicates, and irrelevant tweets.
- Tokenize the text data and remove stop words.
- Apply techniques for handling emojis, URLs, and special characters.
- Label the tweets with sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) using pre-trained sentiment lexicons or machine learning models.

### Task 3: Data Analysis with Apache Spark
- Utilize Spark's MLlib for sentiment analysis using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes.
- Train the sentiment analysis model on a portion of the dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Apply the trained model to classify the sentiment of the entire dataset.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Spark SQL and DataFrame operations to understand the distribution of sentiments, top keywords, and user engagement metrics.

### Task 4: Data Visualization
- Use Apache Spark's integration with visualization libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visualizations directly from Spark DataFrames.
- Visualize the distribution of sentiment scores, word clouds of most frequent terms, and time-series plots of tweet volume over time.
- Generate interactive visualizations using tools like Plotly or Bokeh for better exploration and presentation of insights.
- Analyze the results of sentiment analysis to uncover trends and patterns in public opinions.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Completeness and clarity of the final report and code.
- Depth of analysis and effective utilization of Apache Spark functionalities.
